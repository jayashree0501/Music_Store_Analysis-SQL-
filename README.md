ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project involves analyzing a music store's database to extract meaningful insights about sales, customer behavior, and inventory management. Utilizing MySQL, the project demonstrates how SQL queries can be applied to real-world business scenarios to inform decision-making.

2) Import all the csv files into the respective tables
3) writing a sql queries to find the insights

# CHALLENGES FACED
1) **Importing large data** : Some files are very large ,they consume too much time to import correctly.
2) **Complex SQL queries** : Writing queries with multiple joins, window functions, and CTEs was challenging. It required careful structuring and testing to get correct results.
3) **Undestanding relationship between tables** : To understanding the relationship between tables are time consuming.

# CONCLUSION:
1) This project helps in understanding that how the SQL queries extract actionable insights from the data.
